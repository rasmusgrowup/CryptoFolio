# CryptoFolio
Welcome to the CryptoFolio project. This project is a simple web application that allows users to track their cryptocurrency investments.

The application is built using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and a postgresql database. The cryptocurrency data is fetched from the CoinCap API (https://docs.coincap.io/?version=latest).

## Running the project
To build and run the project, simply create a postgresql database, and configure the connection in the `application.properties` file and run the project using the `mvn spring-boot:run` command.
